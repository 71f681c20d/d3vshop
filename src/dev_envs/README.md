# Dev Environments for AI Agents

- Configuration for reusable Docker images
- The Docker containers are utilized by AI agents to perform various workflows
- The containers are used for executing code, reading stdout, and using the stdout to make changes to the code before re-executing
- The containers contain fixed, predifined versions of everything needed in the dev environment, so the code will always run the same everytime you execute the workflow


Development environments for agents to use:
- Solana
    - Solana CLI
    - Rust
    - Anchor
