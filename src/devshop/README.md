# DevShop

This is the part of the source code where configurations are loaded and the workflow is executed

- The workflow uses Autogen to orchestrate and execute the workflow
- A workflow is composed of *conversations*. The conversations are treated as *tasks*, as they have a certain set of requirements and expected results, such as a design decision or deployable code.
