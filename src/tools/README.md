# Agent Tools

Here, a collection of python functions (tools) can be created to equip agents

Tools can be used for:
- Interacting with the outside world (calling an API, reading a website, posting to social media, running a shell script, etc...)
- Performing repetetive tasks reliably (unit conversions, etc..)

Under the *agents* directory, you can configure each agent to be equipped with select tools
